<h1>F.A.Q</h1>

<div id="text">
<h2>What is Relove Me?</h2>

<p>Instagram is a fun and quirky way to share your life with friends through a <br>
  series of pictures. Snap a photo with your mobile phone, then choose a filter<br> 
  to transform the image into a memory to keep around forever.We're building<br> 
  Instagram to allow you to experience moments in your friends' lives through<br> 
  pictures as they happen. We imagine a world more connected through photos.</p>

<h2>How much is your app?</h2>

<p>$0.00 - available for free in the Apple App Store and Google Play store.</p>

<h2>Where does the name come from?</h2>

<p>When we were kids we loved playing around with cameras. We loved how different types<br> 
of old cameras marketed themselves as "instant" -something we take for granted today.<br> 
We also felt that the snapshots people were taking were kind of like telegrams in that<br> 
they got sent over the wire to others - so we figured why not combine the two?</p>

<h2>What other services are you compatible with?</h2>

<p>Currently, you can share your photos on a photo-by-photo basis on Flickr, Facebook, and<br> 
Twitter. Additionally, if you specify a location with your photo, you can opt to have us<br> 
check you in on Foursquare. Going forward, we plan on supporting additional services but<br> 
have nothing else to announce at this time.</p>

<h2>Are you hiring?</h2>

<p>Absolutely, yes. If you're a talented engineer or designer we want to talk to you.<br> 
Check out our jobs page.</p>

<h2>I have a technical problem or support issue I need resolved, who do I email?</h2>

<p>The best way to get in touch with us is to visit our support center.</p>

<h2>Is there an API or developer program?</h2>

<p>Developers can register for our api at our developer site.</p>

<h2>How does privacy work?</h2>

<p>We have adopted a follower model that means if you're "public" on Instagram, anyone can<br> subscribe to follow your photos. We do, however, have a special private option. In this mode,<br> 
a user can make sure he/she must approve all follow requests before they go through.<br>

<h2>Who can see my photos?</h2>

<p>All photos are public by default which means they are visible to anyone using Instagram or<br> 
on the instagram.com website. If you choose to make your account private, then only people who<br> follow you on Instagram will be able to see your photos.</p>

<h2>How can I print my photos?</h2>

<p>We save all the photos you process with Instagram to your camera roll. You can then sync with<br> your computer and print as many as you'd like.</p>

<h2>When are you going to make the app for Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, iPad, etc?</h2>

<p>We are currently working on making the iPhone and Android experiences as solid as possible.<br> 
Only then will we consider other platforms, but currently we have nothing to announce.</p>
